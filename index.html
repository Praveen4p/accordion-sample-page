                        <p>This war was unique in the way that it did not involve the issue of Kashmir, but was rather
                        precipitated by the crisis created by the political battle brewing in erstwhile East Pakistan
                        (now Bangladesh) between Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Leader of East Pakistan, and Yahya Khan and
                        Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, leaders of West Pakistan. This would culminate in the declaration of
                        Independence of Bangladesh from the state system of Pakistan. Following Operation Searchlight
                        and the 1971 Bangladesh atrocities, about 10 million Bengalis in East Pakistan took refuge in
                        neighbouring India.India intervened in the ongoing Bangladesh liberation movement.After a large
                        scale pre-emptive strike by Pakistan, full-scale hostilities between the two
                        countries commenced.</p>

                        <p>The Sino-Indian War, also known as the Indo-China War, Sino-Indian Border Conflict and, by some,
                        Clash on the Roof of the World,was a war between China and India that occurred in 1962. A
                        Chinese disputed Himalayan border was the main cause of the war. There had been a series of
                        violent border skirmishes between the two countries after the 1959 Tibetan uprising, when India
                        granted asylum to the Dalai Lama. India initiated a defensive Forward Policy from 1960 to hinder
                        Chinese military patrols and logistics, in which it placed outposts along the border, including
                        several north of the McMahon Line, the eastern portion of the Line of Actual Control proclaimed
                        by Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai in 1959</p>

                        <p>Smiling Buddha (MEA designation: Pokhran-I) was the assigned code name of India's first
                        successful nuclear bomb test on 18 May 1974. The bomb was detonated on the army base Pokhran
                        Test Range (PTR), in Rajasthan, by the Indian Army under the supervision of several key Indian
                        generals.

                        Pokhran-I was also the first confirmed nuclear weapons test by a nation outside the five
                        permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. Officially, the Indian Ministry of
                        External Affairs (MEA) characterised this test as a "peaceful nuclear explosion". Indira Gandhi,
                        the then Prime Minister of India saw a massive rise in popularity following this test. After
                        this, a series of nuclear tests were carried out in 1998 under the name Pokhran-II.</p>
